            8/25/23 - We played a game with pvc pipes and a marble. We had to work as a team to get the marble into the small bucket. We had a plan but it didn't work as we wanted it to work. We also set up our website page. The process was ok but it has many steps and is very specific. Mr. Kim taught us how to change the font and the way the words are arranged on the website.

            9/11/23 - We started to work on the Rube Goldberg project. We made a model on CAD. Then we started to cut and make it out of cardboard. We are having trouble stabalizing it with tape but so far its going good.
           
           <p></p>
            9/25/23 - We completed the project and we made a boat that hold weight. Our boat held 82 grams of metal. It held the weight for the whole time it had to but we didn't have the most amount so we didn't win.
            <p></p>
            9/29/23 - Me and Brooklyn disected a computer. It went pretty well and it turned on after we put everything back together.
            <p></p>
            10/10/23 - Brooklyn, Mark, and I created a hand out of cardboard. The task was to make the hand be able to grab a water bottle. We somewhat succeded but just like the ghecko they have sticky type skin to be able to climb and grab stuff so we added tape to help the hand have grip. I would not count it as a succes but it was fun to make and plan the structure of the hand.
            <p></p>
            10/24/23 - Erin, Brooklyn, and I had to make a bottle rocket. We started with a 2 litter bottle and then we added cardboard to it. We started with fins so it could cut through the air and have a path through the air. Then we added a papper cone to the top so it had better flight path. When we launched it, it didn't go as far as we wanted to but it was fun to watch it blast off.
            <p></p>
            11/2/23 - We started by making digital circuits on tinker cad. Then we got into the hardwear of it and make a bread board that has diodes the have patters and timing for the lighting. The hardwear part is my favorite part because i like to work with physical part and tools.
            <p></p>
            11/20/23 - Brooklyn, Mark, and I made a pitch for a product. Our product was a fully secure 7-eleven system that is impossible to steal or break into. The lesson was to learn about buyers opinion and marketing for buisinesses. Peope didn't find the idea the best but its ok because the idea is smart and maybe possible for the future. It was fun to see all the other ideas and make our own idea. 
            <p></p>
            1/12/24 - Brooklyn, Tony and I had a project to make oobleck. We used 3/4 cup of cornstarch and a half cup of water. It had to be able to cut and be in a solid state. It was a lot of fun to make and it was very stisfying.

            <li>The weight of the bridge was 32.7 grams.</li>
            <li>The weight held by our bridge was 447 grams.</li>
            <li>The ratio of weight held by the bridge to the weight of the bridge was approximately 13.7 to 1.</li>
            <li>The heaviset part of the bridge was the glue. We used the glue to make the connections more sturdy and stable</li>
            <li>The design of our bridge came from Brooklyn's inspiration from the Golden Gate Bridge, located in San Fransisco California.</li>
            <li>The design did not work as intended. We expected it to hold up more weight but due to the unstable location it collapsed faster.</li>
            <li>The point of falure of the bridge was a single strand in the middle of the bridge.</li>
            <li>We can use more spaghetti and glue to change the outcome dramaticly.</li>

            2/14/24 - Me and Brooklyn have worked on the mouse trap project for two weeks. The first week was to plan and find the right mesurements and calculation. We started by getting inspirtion from Mark Rober. We designed a mouse trap car and calculated the estimated distance it would travel. After two days we started to design the car on cardboard. The car was looking good at first but once we tested the first itaration it was not functional. The rear axel had too much friction and the car would not go straight. Once we saw the mistakes we made we started brainstorming the new design. We began to use straws so that the axel would not have as much friction. We then fixed the front wheels because the front wheels would not go straight. After that we changed the mouse trap arm postion so it has more string to pull on and more rotation of the axel. The second model was a lot cleaner and had better end results. We then took the car to the cafeteria and tested it with other cars. It unfortunately did not go as far as we wanted it to go because it ran into another car.
            <p></p>
            3/4/24 - The whole class is reviewing the project and we are planning a egg drop. We have made a design for the egg so it does not break on impact. We are surronding the egg with cotton balls and then with duck tape and a box. We are putting popsicle sticks on the outside so when it hits on the ground it will disperce the impact so it is not focused on the egg.
