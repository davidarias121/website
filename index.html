            8/25/23 - We played a game with pvc pipes and a marble. We had to work as a team to get the marble into the small bucket. We had a plan but it didn't work as we wanted it to work. We also set up our website page. The process was ok but it has many steps and is very specific. Mr. Kim taught us how to change the font and the way the words are arranged on the website.

            9/11/23 - We started to work on the Rube Goldberg project. We made a model on CAD. Then we started to cut and make it out of cardboard. We are having trouble stabalizing it with tape but so far its going good.
